Testing instructions for all the coupon collector's programs
in this repository.

Read REFERENCES for information about the coupon collector's
problem.

Each program in this repository reads one parameter, which
is the number of coupons in the test.

--------

Program by program testing instructions.

Fibonacci random number generator

Run fibocoup to apply the coupon collector's test to the fibonacci
random number generator.  There is one parameter.

./fibocoup n

Where n is the number of coupons.

Example:

./fibocoup 5

The expected result from this program is a failing P-value
of 1.0.

--------

64 bit LFSR random number generator

Run lfsrcoup to apply the coupon collector's test to the 64 bit
LFSR random number generator.  There is one parameter.

./lfsr n

Where n is the number of coupons.

Example:

./lfsrcoup 5

The expected result from this program is a failing P-value
of 1.0.

--------

32 bit RANDU random number generator

Run randu to apply the coupon collector's test to the 32 bit
RANDU random number generator.  There is one parameter.

./rucoupon n

Where n is the number of coupons.

Example:

./rucoupon 5

The expected result from this program is a passing P-value
some of the time.  Because RANDU is a weak random number
generator, the program fails more often than expected.

--------

eegl64 random number generator

Run coupon to apply the coupon collector's test to the eegl64
uniform random number generator.  There is one parameter.

./coupon n

Where n is the number of coupons.

Example:

./coupon 5

This test is expected to pass the chi square test.

--------

etaus random number generator

Run etauscoup to apply the coupon collector's test to the etaus
uniform random number generator.  There is one parameter.

./etauscoup n

Where n is the number of coupons.

Example:

./etauscoup 5

This test is expected to pass the chi square test.

--------

GNU Scientific Library random number generators

Run tstgsl.sh to apply the coupon collector's test to the GNU
Scientific Library collection of random number generators.
There are two parameters, the number of coupons and the name
of the GSL generator.

./tstgsl.sh n RNG_name 

Example,

./tstgsl.sh 5 taus2

This example runs the coupon collector's test on the GSL taus2
random number generator.

To find a list of valid GSL random number generators, enter
a parameter that produces an error.

./tstgsl.sh 5 ?

This test is expected to pass the chi square test for most of
the generators.

To run a test of all GSL generators, run runall.sh.

./runall.sh n

Where n is the number of coupons.

Example:

./runall.sh 5

Read the results of this test by browsing allgsl.out.
This test reads allgsl.lst as an input file.

--------

Dieharder package random number generators

Run tstdie.sh to apply the coupon collector's test to the
dieharder collection of random number generators.  There are
two parameters, the number of coupons and the id of the
dieharder generator.

./tstdie.sh n RNG_number

Example,

./dietmplt.sh 5 053

This example runs the coupon collector's test on the dieharder
taus2 random number generator.

To find a list of valid dieharder random number generators,
enter the following dieharder command.

dieharder -g -l

This test is expected to pass the chi square test for most
of the random number generators.

To run a test of all dieharder generators, run dieall.sh.

./dieall.sh n

Where n is the number of coupons.

Example:

./dieall.sh 5

Read the results of this test by browsing alldie.out.
This test reads alldie.lst as an input file.

--------

Binary Coupon Collector's Test

Run bitcoup to run the coupon collector's test with binary
data.  This test is only run with the eegl64 random number
generator.

./bitcoup n

Where n is the number of coupons.

Example:

./bitcoup 5

This test is expected to pass the chi square test.
